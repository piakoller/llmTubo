The stratification factors are not predictive, but prognostic. 

A watch-and-wait approach is recommended in asymptomatic low-grade tumour patients with absence of morphological progression. Locoregional therapy may be considered as an alternative approach to systemic therapies in SI- and Pan-NETs in liver disease only or predominant liver disease if extrahepatic lesions are stable. 

Locoregional therapy may also be considered early in NET G2 patients and advanced disease. 

In Pan-NET G3 with moderate Ki-67, the treatment is similar to Pan-NET G2. The choice of ChT is mainly based on the tumour growth rate and Ki-67. STZ-based and TEM-based therapies provide similar ORRs, although a comparative study is not available. 

STZ has been combined with doxorubicin in Pan-NETs and produced high ORRs, but its use is limited due to potential cardiotoxicity to maximal cumulative dose of 400

mg/m2. 

One author \(EPK\) indicates that in SSTR-positive Pan-NET G1/G2 \(Ki-67 <10%\) PRRT might be considered after first-line SSA or chemotherapy, equal to the choice of targeted drugs and that in SI NET G2 \(Ki-67>10%\) PRRT could be considered equal to everolimus.
